# nrooks.py : Solve the N-Rooks problem!
# D. Crandall, 2016
# Updated by Zehua Zhang, 2017
# Modified by Augustine Joseph
# The N-rooks problem is: Given an empty NxN chessboard, place N rooks on the board so that no rooks
# can take any other, i.e. such that no two rooks share the same row or column.
